# Condo-On-Line

This is a Node.js application I did for my apartment building in Brazil. 

 It has a message board with posts, a page where you can list good contractors (blumbers, caterers, electricians, etc.) and a page to schedule the use of the party lounge.

The index is basically a dashboard of the tree previouse pages, using the Async module.

The app was written for a building in Brazil, so routes and other user facing informations are in portuguese.  Models, schemas and dev facing information are in english.

The first version had a file uploader using Multer.js, but that was not very useful, so I deleted that part.

There is a  media querey for smaller screens in the CSS file.

The template used was a Bootstrap Zontal, found here (https://graygrids.com/item/free-bootstrap-admin-template-zontal-admin/)

This application was done by reading online tutorials, watching videoes, doing som Free Code Camp and other online reasorces. It is very different from realy learning a language or even a framework. After completing this simple application I decided I first needed to learn how to read code before I write.  This is why I don`t have anymore commits.
